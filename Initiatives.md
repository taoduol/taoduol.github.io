					<h3>RESCO</h3>
					<h4>Research Evaluation for Systemic Care Optimization</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The Research Evaluation for Systemic Care Optimization (RESCO) initiative is designed to build a collaborative community that addresses hospital-based health inequities and care delivery gaps by transforming emerging evidence into actionable change within healthcare systems. We apply systems thinking to align processes, resources, and stakeholders in ways that enhance efficiency, reduce costs, improve quality, and ensure equitable access to care. Spanning all specialties, RESCO develops models and solutions that can be integrated into standard practice, inform future guidelines, and accelerate the impact of emerging evidence to improve the way patients are served. </p>
	<p>The premise of RESCO is to center equity—treating it with the same priority as safety—so that it becomes a guiding principle woven into every hospital decision.</p>
   <p> RESCO is a multi-phase initiative currently in its early stages. More information will be available soon.</p>

					<h3>The Alando Exchange</h3>
					<h4>Amplifying Learning And Nurturing Diverse Opportunities</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The Alando Exchange is more than just a mentorship program; it's a community dedicated to building the next generation of well-rounded professionals. We understand that a  career isn't just built in the classroom—it's forged through practical, applied experiences. </p>

<p>Our initiative provides high school and college students with one-on-one mentorship and dynamic programming to help them take ownership over their careers. We actively help students navigate the process of seeking work experience. </p>

<p>Our ultimate goal is to elevate others, offer advice, and inspire a culture of service in our mentees. We believe that by gaining practical experience and sharing a wealth of open resources to support students in crafting their professional narrative, students will not only find their own paths but also be equipped to guide others on theirs.</p>

					<h3>Combatting SF Medicines</h3>
				</header>
				<p>This initiative addresses the growing threat of substandard or falsified (SF) medicines, a risk heightened by the rise of unauthorized online pharmacies. The project aims to protect patients by bringing together researchers, drug enforcement agencies, and government partners. Specifically, we seek to better understand the scope and nature of the challenges, identify opportunities for shared solutions and coordinated efforts, and drive research and innovation to develop new strategies for patient protection.</p>
	<p>This project is currently underway, with more details coming soon. In the meantime, explore the collaborators leading this work and additional resources below.</p>
