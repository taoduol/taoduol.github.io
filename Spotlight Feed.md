<p style="color: black;"> Excited to have attended my favorite scientific conference once again! The BESAFE Conference, hosted by Johns Hopkins University, brings together academic scientists, policymakers, and legal experts from diverse fields‚Äîchemistry, public health, supply chain management, economics, and more‚Äîfrom around the world to discuss the burden and impact of substandard and falsified (SF) medicines on human health.</p>

<p style="color: black;"> SF medicines remain an unfamiliar issue to many in healthcare, including providers and pharmacists, as it is rarely addressed in clinical training. However, it poses an immense risk to patient safety. This conference provides an important platform to share evidence and strategies to combat this problem. By characterizing the burden in both high-income and low- and middle-income countries, we can better understand the nuances of the issue and mobilize stakeholders to allocate resources effectively to keep patients safe.</p>

<p style="color: black;"> I look forward to attending this conference again in the future and highly recommend it to anyone interested in this important topic. It‚Äôs free to attend, and the community is incredibly welcoming and collaborative.</p>

<p style="color: black;"> In October, I had the privilege of attending the incredible 2025 Nurturing Excellence and Unifying Sisters in Medicine (NEXUS) Conference hosted by the Association of Black Gastroenterologists and Hepatologists (ABGH). This was my second time attending, and I have to say (again!)‚Äîit‚Äôs hands down my favorite conference ever.</p>

<p style="color: black;"> Focused on wellness and excellence among Black women, the weekend was filled with empowering sessions. We heard from leaders exploring topics like wellness for Black women, navigating career changes, managing finances, and channeling our inner resilience while also prioritizing self-care.</p>

<p style="color: black;"> This conference provided a space blessed with so many successful and hardworking Black women, leaders, and changemakers. It was a refreshing, safe space where we could come together, connect, and uplift each other.</p>

<p style="color: black;"> I‚Äôm already looking forward to attending future conferences and encourage my Black sisters in healthcare to sign up‚Äîyou don‚Äôt want to miss out! </p>

<p style="color: black;"> In September, I had the privilege of attending The Washington Center‚Äôs Health Policy Immersion Program. Throughout the program, our cohort had the opportunity to hear from leaders in health policy across academia, government, journalism, and think tanks. This experience brought together students and professionals from all over the country, and I‚Äôm grateful to have made lasting connections with amazing peers and new friends.</p>
<p style="color: black;"> The program culminated with an insightful field trip to DC Medicaid, where we learned about the critical work being done to support our population‚Äôs health needs. A key theme that emerged in our discussions was the importance of adaptability in the face of a constantly evolving policy landscape. Resilience was highlighted as a central trait by every panelist.</p>
<p style="color: black;"> A heartfelt thank you to the organizers for making this incredible experience possible and to The Washington Center for creating spaces for immersive, shared learning.</p>
